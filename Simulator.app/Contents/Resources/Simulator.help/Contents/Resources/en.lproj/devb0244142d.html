It is also important to test your app on physical devices as there are hardware and API differences between a simulated device and a physical one. In addition to those differences, Simulator is an app running on a Mac and has access to the computer’s resources, including the CPU, memory, and network connection. These resources are likely to be very different in capacity and speed than those found on a mobile device requiring tests of performance, memory usage, and networking speed to be run on physical devices.</p><p>Use the differences between Simulator and physical devices to help you determine what features and functionality to test in Simulator and what to test on physical devices.</p><div id="dev811dfef45" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">General differences</h2><ul><li><p>Performance testing for processing, graphics, and networking must be done on physical devices for accurate results.</p><p>Simulator is an app running on a Mac using the computer’s resources including the CPU, memory, and network connection.

Simulator differs from the hardware processor in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p>Simulator does not use a tile-based deferred renderer.</p></li><li><p>Simulator does not provide a pixel-accurate match to the graphics hardware.</p></li></ul><div class="Alert"><p class="Important"><strong>Important: </strong>The OpenGL ES support in Simulator should be used to help you get started writing an OpenGL ES app. Never assume that Simulator reflects the real-world performance or the precise capabilities of the graphics processors used in iOS devices. Always profile and optimize your drawing code on a real device.</p></div></div></body></html>
