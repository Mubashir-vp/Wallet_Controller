To add your complication to the gallery, you create a complication bundle that gives the user a preview of your complication. The complication bundle is stored in your iOS app bundle and used by the Apple Watch app to populate the gallery area. Each complication bundle includes localizable, static previews of the complications that you build using the ClockKit framework. Follow the steps below to create your complication bundle and add it to your iPhone app.</p><div id="dev4064d27ac" class="Task no-header"><div class="TaskBody" role="region" aria-hidden="false" id="aria-dev4064d27ac"><ol><li><p>In your Complications controller code, implement <code>getLocalizableSampleTemplateForComplication:withHandler:</code>.
